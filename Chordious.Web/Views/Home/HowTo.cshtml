        <p>Chordious Web is a quick and easy way to generate chord diagrams for a variety of stringed instruments, tunings, and chord qualities.  
        The purpose of the application is to serve as an on-line chord dictionary.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Selections</h3>
        <p>Let's start by taking a look at the selections available.</p>
        <img src="~/Images/Selections.PNG" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>First, select an instrument from the list.  I'm going to select "Ukulele":</p>
        <img src="~/Images/InstrumentSelection.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>After you select an instrument, the list of tunings becomes available.  I'm going to select standard C6 tuning from the list:</p>
        <img src="~/Images/TuningSelection.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>Next, I want to select the root chord that I would like to get.  In this case, I am going to select "C":</p>
        <img src="~/Images/ChordRootSelection.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>Lastly, I will select the chord quality.  In this case, I am going to select "Major":</p>

        <h3>Options</h3>
        <img src="~/Images/Options.PNG" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>After the selections are made, we can modify the options available for the chords.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Num Frets:</b> The number of frets that you would like to see in your chord diagram.</li>
            <li><b>Max Frets:</b> The total number of frets that are on your selected instrument.</li>
            <li><b>Max Reach:</b> The span of frets that you can easily reach with your fingers while playing a chord.</li>
            <li><b>Auto Add Barres:</b> Have the application automatically add barre lines for barred chords.</li>
            <li><b>Allow Open Strings:</b> Include chord diagrams that include open strings.</li>
            <li><b>Allow Muted Strings:</b> Include chord diagrams that include muted strings.</li>
            <li><b>Mirror Results:</b> Mirroring the results creates chord diagrams for left-handed players.</li>
            <li><b>Allow Rootless Chords:</b> Include chord diagrams that do not have the root note in the chord played.</li>
            <li><b>Find Chords</b> Generates the chord diagrams based upon your selections and options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example i am just using the default options selected along with the instrument, tuning, chord root and chord quality
        that I selected in the first section.  I will now click the "Find Chords" button:</p>
        <img src="~/Images/Results.PNG" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>If I want to generate chord diagrams for a left-handed player, I would select "Mirror Results" in the options then click the
        "Find Chords" button:</p>
        <img src="~/Images/MirroredResults.PNG" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>Scroll your browser's window to display all of the different chord diagrams that were generated.</p>

        <h3>Saving Chord Diagrams</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>The chord diagrams that are generated by Chordious Web are in the SVG file format.  These are Scalable Vector Graphics, which are essentially text based
        images that the browser interprets as an image.  You may, or may not be able to save the chord diagrams from Chordious Web.  If you really need to save the
        chord diagrams, I highly recommend that you download and install the full version of Chordious from <a href="http://chordious.com">http://chordious.com</a>.
        There are versions of the application that will run in Windows, Mac, and Linux.  The program is completely free.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, there are ways to save the chord diagrams that are generated through Chordious Web.</p>
        <p>The simplest method currently only works with Internet Explorer.  Right-click on the chord diagram that you want to save.  From the pop-up menu that
        appears, select "Save picture as..." When the save file dialog appears, the default file type that it will try to save the image as is SVG.  You can change
        the file type by clicking the drop-down next to "Save as type" and select either PNG or BMP as the image type.  Give the file a name and click save.</p>
        <img src="~/Images/SavePicture.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>The next method involves snipping the image from the screen and saving it.  In Windows, click the "Start" button and open the "Accessories" folder. 
        Click on "Snipping Tool."  The snipping tool allows you to select an area on the screen and save it as an image.</p>
        <img src="~/Images/Snip1.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>When you open the snipping tool, your screen will become slightly opaque and your mouse pointer will turn into a set of cross-hairs.  Move your mouse
        pointer to the upper left corner of the image that you want to save.  Click and drag your mouse to the bottom right corner of the image.  This will create
        a selection on the screen.  When you release the mouse button, the image will appear in the snipping tool.</p>
        <img src="~/Images/Snip2.png" />
        <br /><br />
        <p>Click "File -> Save As" from the menu and you can save the image in the PNG, GIF, or JPG file format.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Macintosh has a similar function to the Snipping Tool called the "Grab Tool" which can be found in the "Accessories -> Utilities" folder.  Unfortunately
        I cannot explain the process for using this tool as I do not have access to a Mac to test with, but the process should be similar to the Snipping Tool
        in Windows.</p>
